# Big Data Science Project (Group 34)
In this project we try to get a sense of the overall feeling of the people in Belgium towards the corona virus, and in particular against the measures of the government.
Additionally, we tried to relate this towards the trends in gambling and the impact of the virus on companies like EuroMillions.

We wondered what the impact was of the lockdown on the number of people that play on euromillions.
Perhaps people were drawn to the game because they were anxious for the future and hoped to win some extra money.
Or perhaps they have a lot on their minds and playing euromillions isn't top priority.
It's also quite possible that a lot of those euromillions purchases are rather impulse purchases: people are driving in their cars, go thanking and stop by the shop of the gasstation. They see they can buy an euromillions ticket and do so. If a country is in lockdown, there is a lot less traffic, people go less to stores, ... so that would mean that the number of euromillions purchases would be a lot less.
On the other hand, anyone can play online on euromillions. So actually people don't need those shops any more to play if they really want, there is a complete online alternative.
So there are a lot of factors that are playing, and it's difficult to predict what will gain the upper hand.
Another interesting thing about the euromillions case, is that we can easily see if the effect is the same in other european countries.
We try to find that if a country is hit hard by the corona crisis, what this means for the impact on the number of purchased euromillions tickets.

To achieve this, we scraped the EuroMillions websites for statistical data and we gathered tweets concerning the virus and the measures around it.

The data was processed by using Spark and Spark ML.


Finally, all data was visualized using PowerBI.
The PowerBI files are provided in this repository, but they will also be used in the report videos.

## Project Structure
In this project you will find the following:

 - **data_processing/**: Jupyter notebooks (and related html files) explaining our data processing methods
 - **demo/**: The end product, PowerBI files used for visualization
 - **data_gathering/**: Additional python scripts for gathering data (more info in their respective folders)
