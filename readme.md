# Big Data Science Project (Group 34)
In this project we try to get a sense of the overall feeling of the people in Belgium towards the corona virus, and in particular against the measures of the government.
Additionally, we tried to relate this towards the trends in gambling and the impact of the virus on companies like EuroMillions.
To achieve this, we scraped the EuroMillions websites for statistical data and we gathered tweets concerning the virus and the measures around it.

The tweets were processed by using a Machine Learning classifier trained on Dutch book review data.
More info on this can be found in the Jupyter notebook.

Todo: Some more info about EuroMillions

Finally, all data was visualized using PowerBI.
The PowerBI files are provided in this repository, but they will also be used in the report videos.

## Project Structure
In this project you will find the following:

 - **data_processing/**: Jupyter notebooks (and related html files) explaining our data processing methods
 - **demo/**: The end product, PowerBI files used for visualization
 - **data_gathering/**: Additional python scripts for gathering data (more info in their respective folders)
