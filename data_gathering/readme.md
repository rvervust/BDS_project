# Data Gathering

This directory contains the code used for data gathering.
The folder structure is as follows:

- twitter_pull/ contains a python script to gather past twitter tweets based on a given keyword and date
 - twitter_stream/ contains a python script to setup a connection to twitter and receive tweets via stream based on keywords
 - The ScrapingLottoFinal notebook contains the code used to scrape the data related to EuroMillions
 
Note: twitter_config.json.example should be updated with working twitter API keys for the code to work.
